## Climate Change and Agricultural Lending

### Motivation
Agriculture is very vulnerable to the impact of climate change. While many have focused on agricultural yields, few examine the role of financial institutions in responding to such impact. In this project, I have created a novel dataset that helps understand how climate change affects lending to U.S. farms. 

### Key Facts
1. **U.S. Farms Vary by Size** \
